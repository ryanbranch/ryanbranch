# Hello!

## My name is Ryan Branch. <br />
### I'm a software engineer with nearly 4 years of profesional software development experience. I previously worked for 3 years on computer vision software, but in the year since I have since shifted my focus to blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. My language of choice is **Python**, and I'm also strong with **C++** and **JavaScript** along with a variety of other languages and frameworks. My interests include decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), procedural generation, machine learning, image processing, and digital art.

- I graduated from **The University of Michigan** in **2018** with a **B.S.E. in Chemical Engineering** and a **minor in Computer Science**.
- I’m currently learning **blockchain development and smart contract programming practices**, specifically for the **Tezos** and **Ethereum** blockchains. For development on Tezos, I primarily use the **SmartPy** language. In the case of Ethereum, I am most skilled with **Solidity** but I have also been exploring **Vyper** as an alternative.
- I’m looking to collaborate on **decentralized applications**, especially if you're skilled at frontend web development because it's by far my weakest skill.
- I’m looking for help with **Docker and the creation of my own local Docker images on Ubuntu 20.04**.
- Ask me about **accelerating Python code with Numba**, especially with regard to **digital image processing**.
- How to reach me: **contactryanbranch@gmail.com, or visit [my Contact page](https://ryanbran.ch/contact/) for alternatives**.
- Pronouns: **he/him/his**
